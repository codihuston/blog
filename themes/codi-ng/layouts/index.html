            Welcome to my blog! I'm Codi Huston!
          </p>
          <p class="">
            In this blog, we will talk about my experiences as a software
            engineer, which covers a wide range of topics such as: full-stack
            web development, containerization (Docker, Podman, CNCF),
            Kubernetes, OpenShift, DevOps, GitOps, Software Design, Software
            Architecture, Networking, Systems Administration, and much, much
            more!
          </p>
          <p>
            I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as we explore the
            intersection of technology, security, and the joys of life beyond
            the digital realm. Let's dive deep into discussions and tutorials
            on how to use these everyday technologies. It is my hope that these
            musings will help us all grow and thrive in this rapidly
            evolving industry, whether you are a junior engineer or beyond.
