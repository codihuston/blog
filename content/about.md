# About

{{< about >}}

I embarked on my professional journey in 2015 after graduating with a Bachelor
of Science in Computer Science! For six fulfilling years, I honed my skills as
a web developer and systems administrator for a public university. This
experience not only deepened my understanding of technology but also instilled
in me a strong appreciation for efficient systems and secure infrastructure.

During my tenure, my fascination with containerization and its potential
for revolutionizing software deployment grew. As I delved further into
the world of DevOps, I began exploring the challenges of securing secrets
in containerized environments. In 2019, this exploration led me to an exciting
opportunity where I continue to work today. My current position allows me to
be at the forefront of securing sensitive information in containerized
environments (and beyond).

With a genuine passion for teaching and sharing knowledge, I am dedicated
to providing you with the tools and insights needed to excel in your career.
From coding fundamentals to industry trends, this blog will equip you with
the essential skills to thrive in the ever-evolving world of software
engineering. Together, we'll navigate the challenges, conquer imposter
syndrome, and pave the way for your success as a software engineer.
Let's dive in and unlock your full potential!

## Outside of Work

In my free time, I also enjoy tinkering with my homelab, experimenting with
new technologies, and building personal projects that allow me to push the
boundaries of what I've learned. This blog will serve as a platform for me
to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries in the ever-evolving
landscape of technology, security, and personal interests.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a zest for life outside the realm
of technology. Music has always been a source of inspiration and relaxation
for me, and I love discovering new obscure artists.

Traveling is a newfound passion of mine, having been blessed with the
opportunity to see Japan with my partner. I did not expect to thoroughly enjoy
being a traveler in a foreign land! It was an eye-opening experience, and I
desire to travel more of the world and meet and experience the many people and
cultures that it has to offer. Below are a few of the many places we got
to see in Japan.
