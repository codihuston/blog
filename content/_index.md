In this blog, we will talk about my experiences as a software
engineer, which covers a wide range of topics such as: full-stack
web development, containerization (Docker, Podman),
Kubernetes, OpenShift, Open Container Initiative (OCI), Cloud Native Computing
Foundation (CNCF), DevOps, GitOps, Software Design, Software Architecture,
Networking, Systems Administration, and much, much more!

I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as we explore the
intersection of technology, security, and the joys of life beyond
the digital realm. Let's dive deep into discussions and tutorials
on how to use these everyday technologies. It is my hope that these
musings will help us all grow and thrive in this rapidly
evolving industry, whether you are a junior engineer or beyond.
